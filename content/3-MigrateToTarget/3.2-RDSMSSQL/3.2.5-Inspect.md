1. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio from within the RDP-ed onto EC2 server.

1. Follow the instructions described earlier to connect to the Target RDS SQL Server instance.

1. Inspect the migrated RDS SQL database (dms_sample_target) content, and make sure the following tables have migrated over. You can do that by opening a New Query window to execute the following statement.

    ```sql
    use dms_sample_target
    SELECT *
    FROM dms_sample_target.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
    GO
    ```

1. For Oracle Source, this should show 15 dms_sample base tables and 1 DMS related apply exceptions table for a total of 16 tables created

1. For SQL Server Source, this should show 16 dms_sample base tables and 1 DMS related apply exceptions table for a total of 17 tables created

1. Next, execute the following query:

    ```sql
    use dms_sample_target
    SELECT * FROM dms_sample_target.sport_type;
    GO
    ```
