Now that you have created a new Database Migration Project, the next step is to convert the schema of the source database to the Amazon Aurora MYSQL.

1. Click on the View button, and choose Assessment Report view.

    For Oracle source it will look like

    ![Oracle assessment](/images/3/1/1/3/0001.png?width=80pc)

    SQL Server will look similar just with SQL Server source on left side of the screen and an SQL Server database hierachy instead of Oracle. You'll want to click on dms_sample in MS SQL Server

1. Next, navigate to the Action Items tab in the report to see the items that the tool could not convert, and find out how much manual changes you need to make.

    For MS SQL Server source, it should look like:

    ![Oracle Action](/images/3/1/1/3/0002.png?width=80pc)

    For Oracle source, it should look like:

    ![MSSQL Action](/images/3/1/1/3/0003.png?width=80pc)

    AWS SCT analyzes the schema and creates a database migration assessment report for the conversion to Aurora MySQL. Items with a blue mark next to them cannot be directly translated from the source to the target. Items in green will be translated over from source to target. In this case, this includes the stored procedures. For each conversion issue, you can complete one of the following actions:

    1. Modify the objects on the source database so that AWS SCT can convert the objects to the target Aurora MySQL database.
    2. Instead of modifying the source schema, modify scripts that AWS SCT generates before applying the scripts on the target Aurora MySQL database.

    However, for the sake of time, we skip modifying all the objects that could not be automatically converted. Instead, as an example, you will manually modify one of the stored procedures from within SCT to make it compatible with the target database.
